Welcome to my facebook iCal wrapper!

The unit tests don't run correctly with the Rake test task right now (I only run them with
Rubymine's test runner), put your Facebook UID and key in test/config/config.yml (pattern it
after config_default.yml)

This project depends on a GEM that's not in the GEM library as of yet (my own yamlconfig,
different than the yamlconfig GEM out there).

You can fetch the source from the repository on Github.
