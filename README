After I built this, I realized Google Calendar, which I use for my scheduling, already supports assigning reminders to iCal feeds.  I probably will not contribute much to this now, but it was worth the learning experience!

Welcome to my facebook iCal wrapper!

To run the tests:
* You need a GEM that's not in the GEM library as of yet (my own bwyamlconfig, source is on Github)
 (I only run them with Rubymine's test runner)
* Put your Facebook UID and key in test/config/config.yml (pattern it
after config_default.yml)
